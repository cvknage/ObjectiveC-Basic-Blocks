Objective-C Basic Blocks
========================

What is Objective-C Basic Blocks?

Objective-C Basic Blocks is a small source distribution, that aims to facilitate programming with blocks on iOS.
The goal is to provide basic block support to some system classes.

Objective-C Basic Blocks is not a full featured block framework.

If you can't get enough of blocks, I suggest taking a look at a brilliant framework called
[BlocksKit](http://pandamonia.github.com/BlocksKit)
